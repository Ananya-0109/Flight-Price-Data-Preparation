# Flight-Price-Data-Preparation
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses only on the data preparation pipeline for flight fare prediction.
It combines raw flight datasets (Business & Economy class), cleans the data, and applies feature engineering techniques to create a machine-learning-ready dataset.

The final output is a structured dataset that can be used for predictive modeling (e.g., predicting flight prices).

# Steps Covered

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Checked dataset shape, dtypes, missing values
Looked at categorical vs. numerical features

Data Cleaning
Handled missing values
Converted date/time columns
Processed duration into total minutes

Feature Engineering
Extracted departure & arrival hours
Cleaned stop information

One-hot encoded categorical variables (airline, source, destination, travel class)
