# Flight-Price-Data-Preparation
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses only on the data preparation pipeline for flight fare prediction.
It combines raw flight datasets (Business & Economy class), cleans the data, and applies feature engineering techniques to create a machine-learning-ready dataset.

The final output is a structured dataset that can be used for predictive modeling (e.g., predicting flight prices).

Steps Covered

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Checked dataset shape, dtypes, missing values
Looked at categorical vs. numerical features

Data Cleaning
Handled missing values
Converted date/time columns
Processed duration into total minutes

Feature Engineering
Extracted departure & arrival hours
Cleaned stop information

One-hot encoded categorical variables (airline, source, destination, travel class)
